# Developers Guide

This guide is more for aspiring Meteor developers who seek to create something similar to this website or wish to go further beyond this current build.

## First Step - Install Meteor

The first step to using Meteor is to install it which can be found here [How To Install Meteor](https://docs.meteor.com/install.html).

## Second Step - Create A Local Copy of the Template

The next step is to create a local copy of this template on your computer. First go to our applications page, [Warrior Cravings Github Page](https://github.com/warrior-cravings/warrior-cravings), then click on the green "Code". Once inside the dropdown menu click on "Use This Template" to create a copy to your Github. Then in your Github's Warrior-Cravings, click on "Code" again to open it up with the Github desktop to create a local copy.

## Third Step - Start The Web Page

Once inside the repo, go into the app directory by using the command ```cd app ``` and install libraries with ``` $ meteor npm install ``` then finally run ```$ meteor npm run start ```. You should then see your application at http://localhost:3000.

# Community Feedback

## Positive Feedback

- I like how everything is organized and neat. It's easy to find things on the site. I like how everything is easy to read since the descriptions are short and sweet. I also appreciate how you added where each restaurant could be found and the maps to itâ€”super helpful.
- Very organized! A nice and simple design/layout makes the website easy to navigate.
- I like how the website is simple and informative especially the locations because I had no clue about where they are because I only ever go to the architecture building.
- I like the feeling hungry option because I'm indecisive and can't decide what I want to eat.
- I like how the vendors can add different menu items and update their own profiles.

## Constructive Criticism

- I don't know if it's because I'm on an iPad but when I click on some of the vendors, my screen would go white and I would have to refresh my browser.
- Many people will most likely use it on their phone, so maybe make it fit different webpage sizes.
- Some features should be shown without requiring someone to sign up so people can see if they want to use the site or not.
- Images on the vendor's list page should be relatively the same size to make it look more uniform.
- Maybe a few more pics for each vendor.
